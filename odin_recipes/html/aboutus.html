        <h5>ABOUT US</h5>

        <P>     Everything started with a simple question. ''What's in it?'' </P>
    
        <p>     At one point of all of our lifes we wanted to know what is in a drink and was too afraid or anxious to ask. This is what us, the creator of the webpage, also had exprienced before. We wanted to take this oppurtunity to create a webpage where you can see different cafes, restaurants, access to their menus and not only check the menu but also see how it is made!</p>
